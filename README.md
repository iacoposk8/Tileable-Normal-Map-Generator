# Tileable Normal Map Generator

This project provides a tool for creating tileable normal maps from black and white images. The code processes the image to generate a normal map, which is then converted to SVG format, ensuring high quality and scalability even when resized. Ideal for applications that require detailed, high-resolution textures and scalable assets.
